Chapter 7: Advanced Patterns and Error Handling
Example 2: Basic Graph Flow

Description:
Demonstrates directed graph workflows with conditional routing between agents.
Shows how to create complex multi-agent workflows with approval processes,
revision loops, and conditional branching based on agent responses.

Prerequisites:
- OpenAI API key set in .env file
- AutoGen v0.5+ installed
- Python 3.9+ with asyncio support

Usage:
```bash
python -m chapter7.02_basic_graph_flow
```

Expected Output:
Graph flow demonstration with document review process:
1. Agent1 creates initial document draft
2. Agent2 reviews and passes to Agent3 for decision
3. Agent3 either approves (routes to finalizer) or requests revision (routes back to Agent1)
4. Process continues until approval is achieved
5. Finalizer confirms completion

Key Concepts:
- Directed graph workflow construction
- Conditional routing between agents
- Multi-agent collaboration patterns
- Approval and revision workflows
- Graph-based agent orchestration
- Conditional edge routing
- Workflow state management
