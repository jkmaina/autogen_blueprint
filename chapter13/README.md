# Chapter 10: Performance Optimization

This directory contains code examples for Chapter 10 of "The Complete AutoGen v0.5 Blueprint" book, focusing on performance optimization techniques for AutoGen applications.

## Examples Overview

1. **Model Selection** (`01_model_selection.py`)
   - Strategic model selection based on task complexity
   - Balancing cost vs. performance
   - Tiered approach using different models for different tasks

2. **Asynchronous Processing** (`02_async_processing.py`)
   - Running multiple agent tasks concurrently
   - Using asyncio for non-blocking operations
   - Comparing sequential vs. parallel execution

3. **Caching Strategies** (`03_caching_strategies.py`)
   - Simple response caching
   - Semantic caching based on similarity
   - Tiered caching with different expiration times

4. **Error Handling and Resilience** (`04_error_handling.py`)
   - Retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
   - Circuit breaker pattern to prevent cascading failures
   - Graceful degradation with fallback options

5. **Workflow Optimization** (`05_workflow_optimization.py`)
   - Agent specialization for efficient task distribution
   - Optimized conversation flows with reduced turns
   - Selective context management
   - Performance monitoring and analytics

## Requirements

- AutoGen v0.5+
- Python 3.10+
- Required packages:
  - `autogen`
  - `asyncio`

## Running the Examples

1. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install "autogen>=0.5.7"
   ```

2. Set up your OpenAI API key in the OAI_CONFIG_LIST file:
   ```json
   [
     {
       "model": "gpt-4",
       "api_key": "your_api_key_here"
     },
     {
       "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo",
       "api_key": "your_api_key_here"
     }
   ]
   ```

3. Run any example:
   ```bash
   python 01_model_selection.py
   ```

## Key Optimization Techniques

### Model Optimization
- **Model Selection**: Choose the right model for each task
- **Prompt Engineering**: Craft efficient prompts
- **Parameter Tuning**: Optimize temperature, max tokens, etc.
- **Caching**: Implement response and semantic caching

### System Optimization
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Run operations concurrently
- **Batching**: Group operations for efficiency
- **Resource Management**: Optimize memory and connections
- **Error Handling**: Implement retries and circuit breakers

### Workflow Optimization
- **Agent Specialization**: Create focused, task-specific agents
- **Conversation Flow**: Reduce unnecessary interaction turns
- **Context Management**: Selectively include relevant information
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track and analyze metrics

## Notes

- These examples demonstrate concepts that can be adapted to your specific use cases
- Performance improvements will vary based on your specific application and requirements
- Always measure performance before and after optimization to quantify improvements
