# Chapter 20: Future of AutoGen - Concept Examples

This directory contains conceptual implementations of future AutoGen capabilities discussed in Chapter 16. These examples demonstrate advanced concepts that may be part of future AutoGen versions.

## Examples

### 1. Adaptive Memory Management

File: `adaptive_memory.py`

Demonstrates an advanced memory management system that dynamically adjusts memory allocation based on task complexity and agent needs. Features include:

- Episodic, semantic, and procedural memory types
- Memory optimization based on access patterns
- Knowledge extraction from experiences
- Persistence and retrieval of memories

### 2. Self-Improving Agent

File: `self_improving_agent.py`

Showcases an agent that can improve its own capabilities through experience and feedback. Features include:

- Performance tracking across multiple metrics
- Different learning strategies (reinforcement, supervised, active)
- System prompt evolution based on feedback
- Parameter adjustment based on performance

### 3. Multi-Modal Orchestration

File: `multi_modal_orchestration.py`

Demonstrates seamless handling of different input and output modalities (text, vision, audio) for more natural interactions. Features include:

- Specialized processors for each modality
- Cross-modal integration and reasoning
- Entity matching across modalities
- Unified response generation

### 4. Quantum-Enhanced Reasoning

File: `quantum_enhanced_reasoning.py`

Shows integration with quantum computing for solving complex optimization problems more efficiently. Features include:

- Quantum algorithm simulation (Grover's search, QAOA, quantum ML)
- Complex optimization problem solving
- Large-scale search capabilities
- Natural language interpretation of quantum results

## Running the Examples

These examples are conceptual implementations that simulate future capabilities. They can be run as standalone Python scripts:

```bash
python adaptive_memory.py
python self_improving_agent.py
python multi_modal_orchestration.py
python quantum_enhanced_reasoning.py
```

## Notes

- These examples are conceptual and simulate future capabilities that may be part of AutoGen in upcoming versions.
- The implementations focus on demonstrating the concepts rather than providing production-ready code.
- Some features require external dependencies that are simulated in these examples.
- In a real implementation, these concepts would be integrated with the core AutoGen framework and would use actual LLM calls, quantum processors, etc.
