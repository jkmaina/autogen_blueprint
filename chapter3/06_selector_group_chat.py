Chapter 3: Agent Communication Patterns
Example 6: Selector Group Chat

Description:
Demonstrates intelligent agent selection based on expertise and context using SelectorGroupChat.
Shows how to create a team of domain experts where the most appropriate agent is automatically
selected to handle specific questions based on their expertise and the query content.

Prerequisites:
- OpenAI API key set in .env file
- AutoGen v0.5+ installed
- dotenv package installed

Usage:
```bash
python -m chapter3.06_selector_group_chat
```

Expected Output:
The system will process multi-domain questions by intelligently selecting the most
appropriate expert agents:
- Math expert for calculations and mathematical concepts
- Science expert for physics, chemistry, and biology questions
- History expert for historical events and analysis
- Tech expert for programming and computer science
- General assistant for coordination and general queries

Key Concepts:
- Intelligent agent selection mechanisms
- Domain expertise specialization
- Multi-domain query handling
- Context-aware agent routing
- Expert consultation workflows
- Preventing repeated speakers
