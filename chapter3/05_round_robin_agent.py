Chapter 3: Agent Communication Patterns
Example 5: Round Robin Group Chat

Description:
Demonstrates round-robin group chat where agents take turns speaking in a predefined order.
Shows collaborative workflow between a writer, editor, and critic working together on
creative content with structured turn-based communication.

Prerequisites:
- OpenAI API key set in .env file
- AutoGen v0.5+ installed
- dotenv package installed

Usage:
```bash
python -m chapter3.05_round_robin_agent
```

Expected Output:
A collaborative writing session where:
1. Writer creates initial content
2. Editor reviews and refines the writing
3. Critic provides constructive feedback
The cycle continues for 6 messages total, demonstrating structured team collaboration.

Key Concepts:
- Round-robin group chat mechanics
- Turn-based agent communication
- Collaborative content creation
- Agent role specialization (writer/editor/critic)
- Termination conditions and message limits
- Streaming group chat responses
