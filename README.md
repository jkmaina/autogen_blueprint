## 🎯 Learning Path

### 🌱 **Beginner (Chapters 1-6) - Build Your Foundation**
Start here if you're new to AutoGen or multi-agent systems. Learn the fundamentals and build your first agents.

#### 🚀 **Complete Walkthrough: Your First AutoGen Agent**

Let's create a simple conversational agent step by step:

**1. Set up your environment:**
```bash
cd autogen_blueprint/chapter1/
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"  # Replace with your actual API key
```

**2. Run the basic agent example:**
```bash
python 01_basic_agent.py
```

**3. Here's what the code does (`01_basic_agent.py`):**
```python
import asyncio
from autogen_agentchat.agents import AssistantAgent
from autogen_agentchat.ui import Console
from autogen_agentchat.conditions import MaxMessageTermination

async def main():
    # Create a helpful assistant agent
    agent = AssistantAgent(
        name="helpful_assistant",
        model_client=OpenAIChatCompletionClient(model="gpt-4o-mini"),
        system_message="You are a helpful AI assistant. Be concise and friendly."
    )
    
    # Start a conversation
    result = await Console(
        chat_completion_client=agent.model_client
    ).run_stream(
        task="Hello! Can you help me understand what AutoGen is?",
        termination_condition=MaxMessageTermination(max_messages=4)
    )

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

**4. Expected Output:**
```
🤖 helpful_assistant: Hello! I'd be happy to help you understand AutoGen!
